# Writing Reports

## Including Code in a LaTeX document 

If you wish to include code within an assessment or as the appendix to a report 
then you can do so using either a code listing or a verbatim environment. 
Note that it is not standard practice to include raw code or output within the body of a report.  

I would recommend including the body and description of each function within the relevant question using a verbatim or code listing environment.

## Defining an approach 

### Annoncement

I have had a question by email asking for clarity on the phrase “compare at least two supervised learning approaches” and what is considered a different approach.

In general:

- Using a subset or superset of predictors in the same model would not be considered as separate approaches. 

- Using two different models and selecting which features are relevant in each would be considered separate approaches. 

- Constructing new predictors to use within the same model would be somewhere in-between, depending on the approach taken.
